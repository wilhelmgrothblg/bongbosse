# 🚀 BongBosse Supabase Setup Guide

## Overview

BongBosse now uses **Supabase** (PostgreSQL database) for reliable system storage instead of localStorage. This means:

- ✅ **No more lost data** - Systems are stored in the cloud
- ✅ **Better performance** - Faster queries and real statistics
- ✅ **Real analytics** - Track ROI, win rates, and system performance
- ✅ **Cross-device sync** - Access your systems from anywhere

## Database Structure

### 1. `generated_systems` table

Stores all generated Stryktipset systems with:

- System configuration (risk profile, rows, cost)
- Complete system data (matches, predictions)
- Intelligence data (Kelly Criterion, market analysis)
- Performance results (profit/loss, ROI, correct predictions)

### 2. `correct_systems` table

Stores the official Stryktipset results for each draw:

- Match results for the entire draw
- Used to calculate system performance

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Wait for it to initialize (takes ~2 minutes)

### Step 2: Run Database Schema

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
3. Click **Run** to create the tables and indexes

### Step 3: Get Project Credentials

1. Go to **Settings** → **API**
2. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon public key**

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables

Create `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url_here
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

### Step 5: Deploy & Test

1. Deploy your application
2. Generate a test system
3. Check Supabase dashboard to see the data

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/supabase-systems/save` - Save generated system
- `GET /api/supabase-systems/get-all` - Get all systems
- `POST /api/supabase-systems/process-results` - Process weekend results

## Features

### For Users:

- 📊 **System History** - View all your generated systems
- 📈 **Performance Tracking** - See which risk profiles work best
- 💰 **Profit/Loss Tracking** - Real ROI calculations after results
- 🎯 **Prediction Analysis** - See accuracy of different strategies

### For Developers:

- 🔍 **Query Performance** - Indexed for fast searches
- 📊 **Analytics Ready** - Rich data structure for insights
- 🔒 **Secure** - Row Level Security policies
- 🚀 **Scalable** - PostgreSQL handles millions of records

## Migration from localStorage

The old localStorage data won't automatically transfer. This is actually good because:

1. Old data had no real performance metrics (fake ROI data)
2. New system provides accurate, calculated results
3. Fresh start with reliable cloud storage

## Development Notes

- **Fallback**: If Supabase is unavailable, the app gracefully handles errors
- **Environment**: Use placeholder values in development, real keys in production
- **Testing**: Generate systems to test database integration
- **Monitoring**: Check Supabase dashboard for query performance

## Cost Considerations

Supabase free tier includes:

- 500MB database storage (plenty for system data)
- 2GB bandwidth (sufficient for API calls)
- 50MB file storage (not needed for this app)

Perfect for BongBosse's use case! 🎯
